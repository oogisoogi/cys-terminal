"""Adversarial-round-trip credential sink guard (OPP-15).

A real-browser fallback harvests cookies + User-Agent from an attacker-influenced
page and the bridge seeds them straight into the curl_cffi cookie jar / HTTP
headers (see `executor._bridge_cookies_to_pool` -> `transport.inject_cookies`).
Those values are attacker-influenced input flowing into three credential sinks:

    cookie name  -> session.cookies.set(name, ...)
    cookie value -> session.cookies.set(..., value, ...)
    cookie domain-> session.cookies.set(..., domain=...)   (scope)
    UA string    -> headers["User-Agent"]

This module is a clean-room stdlib sanitizer applying the defensive-security-gate
9 principles to that path. It is NOT a port of any upstream source: AgentReach's
threat sink was an sh `source` + env file (`shlex.quote`), which does not exist in
this engine (verified: no shlex/os.open/source sink in engine/). Only the
*contract* is absorbed — "adversarial round-trip -> value fidelity + zero side
effect" — re-implemented against the real cys sinks (curl_cffi jar, HTTP header,
UA, cookie domain scope).

Principles applied (defensive-security-gate SKILL.md §1-§8):
  §1 deny-by-default allowlist  : each sink declares an allowed character class.
  §3 fail-closed                : unparseable / out-of-scope -> REJECTED (drop).
  §4 over-block on doubt        : a 1-label or public-suffix cookie domain is
                                  rejected outright (conservative, no full PSL).
  §6 strong block mechanism     : CR/LF/CTL are removed at the value BEFORE the
                                  sink, so library header serialization is moot.
  §7 normalize before matching  : NFKC + control/zero-width scan.
  §5 documented residual limit  : see references / module docstring below.

Residual limits (§5, negative knowledge):
  * The public-suffix deny list is a conservative hardcoded mini-list, NOT a full
    PSL — it can go stale. Backstop: any 1-label domain is rejected and any
    uncertain domain is narrowed to the request host by the caller.
  * curl_cffi internal header serialization is out of our control; we defend by
    stripping CR/LF from the value before it reaches the sink (splitting cannot
    occur without CR/LF in the value).
  * Threat model = an adversarial page planting cookies/UA in the browser that
    then leak cross-host or split the outgoing request header. Not a defense
    against a trusted operator's own misconfiguration.
